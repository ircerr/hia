More to come as I parse out all the stuffs to make them usable by others.

See HOWTO.txt for usage

Contact:
  Do not bother with email, nor use wiki, nor submit a bug via tracker,
  nor fork with the intentions of submitting a PR, or anything else
  via github at all besides clone.
  I don't check email often and will ignore github entirely :)
